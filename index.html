<ul>
<li><a href="https://pattaraatt.itch.io/metroid">1. Metroid (Remade)</a></li>
</ul>

<p> During this project, I mostly used the Unity game engine and the C# programming language. I worked on the design of the custom level and the implementation of the custom mechanic that we added (the blood bullets) and also the mechanisms of the missiles and the long beam. 
I also created the Skrees and the Zebs. Additionally, I implemented features such as the health drops from monsters and the lava blocks. I also implemented the damage-taking mechanisms like the health, death, iframes and the knockback and the background audio</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://pattaraatt.itch.io/pong">2. Power Pong</a></li>
</ul>

<p> During this project, I mostly used the Unity game engine and the C# programming language. I worked on this project by myself from implementing the base Pong game's mechanics, such as the game physics and the players' controls, to designing and implementing the powerups. This game currently has 4 powerups: the curve ball, the power shot, the multi-shot, and the phantom shot.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://rafesymonds.itch.io/drawn-together-pulled-apart">2. Drawn Together Pulled Apart</a></li>
</ul>

<p>During this project, I mostly used the Unity game engine, the C# programming language, and Audacity sound editor. I worked on the logic for the level completion pads, created the door and button components, designed the win screen scene, and manually created the sound effects for jumping, landing, magnet merging, and death</p>
